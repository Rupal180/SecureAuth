es# Secure Authentication Module for OS

## Project Overview
This project simulates a secure authentication mechanism similar
to those used in operating systems. The system demonstrates how
user authentication and security controls are handled at the OS level.

## Planned Features
- User registration
- Login authentication
- OTP-based verification
- Session management
- Account lockout after multiple failed attempts
- Security audit logging

## Technologies Used
- C++ Programming Language
- VS Code
- MinGW / GCC Compiler
- Windows API

## Operating System Concepts Used
- Authentication and Authorization
- User Session Management
- Access Control
- Security Logging
- Account Locking Mechanism

## Goal for Day 1
- Create GitHub repository
- Define project scope and objectives
- Prepare base documentation for the project

## Day 2 – Basic Menu Implementation

On Day 2, a basic menu-driven interface was implemented.
This menu acts as the entry point of the authentication system,
similar to how an operating system presents login options.

### Features Added
- Displayed main authentication menu
- Options for:
  - User Registration
  - User Login
  - Exit system
- User input handling for menu selection

This forms the foundation for adding authentication logic
in the upcoming stages.
